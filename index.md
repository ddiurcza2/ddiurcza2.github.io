Thanks for visiting! My name is Daniel Diurczak. I've been working as a structural engineer for the past couple of years, previously at John Deere Construction and Forestry and currently at Electric Boat. In my professional experience I have definitely developed an intense interest in solid mechanics and structural dynamics, and I plan on leveraging this into a masters degree in the near future. 

I really get excited about things that exhibit highly dynamic behavior. Whether it be a mockingbird fluttering at 80 beats per second or a jet fighter pulling massive g maneuvers, I get really excited about how these systems work and I dedicate myself to understanding these behaviors through others accounts and my own research. Paradoxically, I have developed an interest in photography as well. There is a mystifying beauty in capturing chaotic motion. As that dance unfurls itself into the universe, being able to capture a  temporal projection to study and appreciate brings me a lot of joy. So if you want to look at what I've got to show below, you'll see pictures of humanity, landscapes, marvels of engineering, subjective beauty, and a lot of my cat.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this, if you'd like to get in contact with me here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-diurczak-7b5148127/), and my [email](mailto:daniel.diurczak@gmail.com). My [resume](Resume_Updated.pdf) can be pulled up on this page as well. 

I'll create a better version of this in the future but for now here's a link to a [portfolio](portfolio) where what I've captured can be downloaded.
